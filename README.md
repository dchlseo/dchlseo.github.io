# Data Analyst
-------
Hello! I'm DC (David), a data analyst who takes pride in exploring data to uncover meaningful insights about the world. 
During my master's program, I had the opportunity to research the impact of biocognitive mechanisms on human psychology. 
This involved collecting, integrating, and analyzing a variety of data types including psychological, behavioral, and physiological data. 
I have published research papers in international journals based on these studies. 
Skilled in various technologies required for data collection, processing, analysis, and communication, I also have experience in executing projects using machine learning and deep learning frameworks.
